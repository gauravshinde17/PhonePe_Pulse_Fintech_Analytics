## 4. Ingestion Methodology

Raw JSON files were programmatically fetched and flattened using Python.

Steps performed:

1. Iterated year × quarter directories
2. Extracted nested transaction and user objects
3. Standardized column names
4. Validated record counts
5. Exported structured CSV files for warehouse loading

## 5. Storage Policy

Raw JSON snapshots were stored locally during ingestion  
and are not included in this repository to avoid redundancy and size inflation.

All analytical outputs are derived strictly from official PhonePe Pulse data.
